# Abstract

* goal
  * M-of-N-signatures required transactions
    * == ⭐️NEW 'standard' transaction type⭐️

# Motivation

* enable
  * secured wallets,
  * escrow transactions,
  * other use cases | redeeming funds / requires >1 signature

* use cases
  * wallet -- secured by a -- "wallet protection service" (WPS)
    * 2-of-2 signatures required transactions
      * first signature come -- from the -- computer / POSSIBLE compromised with the wallet 
      * second signature come -- from the -- WPS
    * | send protected bitcoins, 
      * user's bitcoin client will contact -- , with the proposed transaction, to the -- WPS
      * WPS will contact -- to the -- user 
        * for confirming / 
          * user INDEED initiated the transaction
          * transaction details
        * communication
          * outside this BIP's scope 
    * recommendations
      * WPS -- MUST provide -- copies of the private key(s) /
        * secure their wallets
        * users can safely store OFF-LINE
          * if the WPS goes out of business -> their coins can be spent 
  * 3@party escrow 
    * == buyer + seller + trusted dispute agent
      * EACH one provides a public key
      * steps
        * buyer will send coins -- into a -- 2-of-3 `CHECKMULTISIG` transaction
        * transaction id -- is sent to -- seller & agent
        * seller 
          * fulfill their obligation
          * ask the buyer -- to -- co-sign a transaction /
            * Reason:🧠co-sign == ALREADY signed by the seller🧠
            * | co-sign it,
              * agree -> buyer sends the tied-up coins -- to the -- seller
              * NOT agree, agent can -- , with cooperation of either buyer or seller, decide -- what happens to the tied-up coins 
    * use 2-of-3 signatures required transactions

# Specification

* NEW standard transaction type (`scriptPubKey`) / 
  * relayed by clients
  * included | mined blocks
    ```
    m {pubkey}...{pubkey} n OP_CHECKMULTISIG
    
    # n <= 3 
    ```
  * `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` transactions
    * redeemed -- via -- standard `scriptSig`
    ```
    OP_0 ...signatures...
    ```
      * `OP_0` is required because of a bug in OP_CHECKMULTISIG; it pops one too many items off the execution stack, so a dummy value must be placed on the stack).

The current Satoshi bitcoin client does not relay or mine transactions with scriptSigs larger than 200 bytes
to accommodate 3-signature transactions, this will be increased to 500 bytes.

# Rationale

* `OP_CHECKMULTISIG`
  * ALREADY enabled opcode
  * the MOST straightforward way -- to support -- several important use cases
  * cons
    * old clients and miners count it as "20 sigops" for purposes of computing how many signature operations are in a block, and there is a hard limit of 20,000 sigops per block-- meaning a maximum of 1,000 multisig transactions per block
* Creating multisig transactions using multiple OP_CHECKSIG operations allows more of them per block.

* The counter-argument is that these new multi-signature transactions will be used in combination with OP_EVAL (see the OP_EVAL BIP), and '''will''' be counted accurately
* And in any case, as transaction volume rises the hard-coded maximum block size will have to be addressed, and the rules for counting number-of-signature-operations-in-a-block can be addressed at that time.

* weaker argument is OP_CHECKMULTISIG should not be used because it pops one too many items off the stack during validation
* Adding an extra OP_0 placeholder to the scriptSig adds only 1 byte to the transaction, and any alternative that avoids OP_CHECKMULTISIG adds at least several bytes of opcodes.

# Implementation

* `OP_CHECKMULTISIG`
  * | old clients & miners,
    * == NON-standard transaction type
