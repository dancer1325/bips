# What is a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) ?

* BIP
  * == design document /
    * describe (technical + rationale) a NEW feature about
      * Bitcoin OR
      * 's processes or environment
    * provide
      * information -- to the -- Bitcoin community
  * 's goal
    * mechanisms / 
      * propose new features
      * collect issue's community input
      * document the design decisions
  * 's author
    * responsible for
      * building consensus | community
      * documenting dissenting opinions
  * == text files / hosted | versioned repository

# BIP Types -- `Type:` --

* Standards Track
  * change / affects | MOST OR ALL Bitcoin implementations
    * _Examples:_ 
      * change the network protocol
      * change block or transaction validity rules
      * change or add the interoperability of applications / use Bitcoin
  * == design document + reference implementation
    * reference implementation
      * recommendations
        * AFTER being reviewed and accepted, create it
      * == code OR patch OR URL to that

* Informational
  * == Bitcoin design issue OR general guidelines OR information to the Bitcoin community
    * ❌!= NEW feature❌
    * ❌!= Bitcoin community consensus OR recommendation❌
      * -> ⚠️users and implementers can ignore them⚠️

* Process
  * around Bitcoin
    * ❌!= Bitcoin codebase❌
  * vs Standards Track BIPs
    * ❌!= topics❌
  * ⚠️requirements⚠️
    * community consensus
      * != recommendations
  * _Examples:_
    * | decision-making process,
      * add procedures,
      * add guidelines,
      * add changes
    * | Bitcoin development,
      * adjust tools or environment 
    * meta-BIP
      * == about BIP process

# BIP Work Flow

* BIP champion OR author / EACH potential BIP
  * == someone /
    * writes the BIP / follows the style and format
    * shepherds the discussions | appropriate forums
    * tries to build community consensus
    * name the BIP -- via -- an alias (== author's name/nick + BIP subject)
      * _Example:_ "bip-johndoe-infinitebitcoins"

* [BIP editors](#bip-editors)

* ❌NOT BIPs use cases❌
  * small enhancements OR patches
    * -> handle DIRECTLY -- via -- Bitcoin issue tracker

* 💡BIPs workflow 💡

* NEW idea for Bitcoin
  * check that it's BIP-able == check |
    * Bitcoin Talk forum
    * Bitcoin Dev mailing list
      * [gnu archived mailing list](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/)
        * [FIRST page os mails](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/?t=20110617064236)
      * [google group mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/bitcoindev)

* "Draft" BIP 
  * BIP author creates
    * | 
      * Bitcoin Dev mailing list
        * Reason:🧠
          * add ADDITIONAL concerns
          * format it🧠
      * this repo
        * follow style
    * recommendations
      * separate SIG mailing list
        * ❌NOT used right now❌
      * dedicated GIT repository OR branch
  * if the [BIP editor](#bip-editors) approves it -> 
    * assign the BIP a number,
    * [label it](#bip-types----type---)
    * assign status "Draft"
    * merge | BIPs git repository

* "Accepted"
  * requirements
    * description clear and complete
    * net improvement
    * solid / NOT complicate the protocol

* "Final"
  * BIP / status = "Accepted" & implementation is completed and accepted by the community 

* "Deferred"
  * NO progress done
  * assigned -- by -- BIP author or editor 
  * BIP editor can re-assign it -- to -- draft status

* "Rejected"
  * == NOT good idea
  * important to record it

* "Active"
  * 👀:= NEVER meant to be completed👀
  * use cases
    * Informational BIPs
    * Process BIPs
  * _Example:_ BIP 1 (this BIP)

* superseded
  * 👀BIP A is superseded -- by a -- DIFFERENT BIP👀
    * -> ⚠️BIP A is obsolete⚠️
  * use cases
    * Informational BIPs  
      * _Example:_ API v2 is replaced -- by -- v1

# What are BIP's parts?

* [Preamble](#bip-header-preamble)
  * _Example:_ top of this file

* Abstract
  * technical issue / is addressed
    * ~200 word
  * _Example:_ [BIP0002's Abstract](bip-0002.md#abstract)

* Copyright/public domain
  * explicitly label
  * place | public domain ( == version | this BIP)
  * license | Open Publication License
  * _Example:_ [BIP0002's Copyright](bip-0002.md#copyright)

* Specification
  * if it's a NEW feature -> describe the syntax + semantics 
  * detailed enough / can be implemented -- by -- any current Bitcoin platform (Satoshi, BitcoinJ, bitcoin-js, libbitcoin)
  * _Example:_ [BIP0008's Specification](bip-0008.md#specification)

* Motivation
  * == why the existing protocol specification is inadequate -- to -- address the problem
    * if insufficient motivation -> may be rejected
  * BIPs' critical part / want to change the Bitcoin protocol
  * _Example:_ [BIP0008's Motivation](bip-0008.md#motivation)

* Rationale 
  * == what motivated the design + particular design decisions + alternative designs ALREADY discussed
    * == provide evidence of consensus
  * _Example:_ [BIP0003's Rationale](bip-0003.md#rationale)

* Backwards Compatibility 
  * use cases
    * BIPs / introduce backwards incompatibilities
  * == backwards incompatibilities + their severity + how to deal with them
    * if insufficient backwards compatibility treatise -> may be rejected
  * _Example:_ [BIP0008's Backwards compatibility](bip-0008.md#backwards-compatibility)

* Reference Implementation 
  * ⚠️required BEFORE getting "Final" status⚠️ 
  * ❌NOT required before getting "Accept" status❌
  * recommendations
    * write AFTER
      * finish the specification and rationale
      * reach consensus
  * != final implementation (+ test code + documentation)
  * _Example:_ [BIP0008's Reference implementation](bip-0008.md#reference-implementation-)

# BIP Formats and Templates

* BIPs formats
  * .mediawiki OR
  * .md

## BIP Header Preamble

* == RFC 822 style headers
* == meta-data
* 💡syntax💡
  * "*"
    * OPTIONAL

  ```markdown
    BIP: <BIP number>
    Title: <BIP title == short (<= 44 characters) descriptive >
    Author: <list of authors real names and OPTIONALLY, email address>
  * Discussions-To: <email address>
    Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
             Withdrawn | Final | Superseded>
    Type: <Standards Track | Informational | Process>
    Created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>
  * Post-History: <dates of postings to bitcoin mailing list>
  * Replaces: <BIP number>
  * Superseded-By: <BIP number>
  * Resolution: <urlToEmailMessageOrOtherWeb>
  ```
  * `Author`
    * if there are >1 -> | separate lines / follow RFC 2822
    * _Example of author:_ 
      * Random J. User <address@dom.ain>
      * Random J. User
  * `Resolution` 
    * use cases
      * BIP type = Standards Track BIPs

While a BIP is in private discussions (usually during the initial Draft phase), a Discussions-To header will indicate the mailing list or URL where the BIP is being discussed
No Discussions-To header is necessary if the BIP is being discussed privately with the author, or on the bitcoin email mailing lists.

The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Standards Track, Informational, or Process.

The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number, while Post-History is used to record the dates of when new versions of the BIP are posted to bitcoin mailing lists
Both headers should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14.

BIPs may have a Requires header, indicating the BIP numbers that this BIP depends on.

BIPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the BIP that replaces the current document
The newer BIP must have a Replaces header containing the number of the BIP that it rendered obsolete.

## Auxiliary Files

BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Image files should be included in a subdirectory for that BIP. Auxiliary files must be named BIP-XXXX-Y.ext, where "XXXX" is the BIP number, "Y" is a serial number (starting at 1), and "ext" is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. "png").

# Transferring BIP Ownership

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of BIPs to a new champion
In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred BIP, but that's really up to the original author
A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the BIP process, 
or has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email)
A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the BIP
We try to build consensus around a BIP, but if that's not possible, you can always submit a competing BIP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a BIP, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the BIP editor
If the original author doesn't respond to email in a timely manner, the BIP editor will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :).

# BIP Editor's responsibilities & workflow

* responsible for
  * checking BIP
    * is ready (sound and complete)
      * if it's 
        * NOT ready -> send it back -- to the -- author
        * ready -> create a PR | [this repo](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips)
    * 's ideas make technical sense
      * ❌ALTHOUGH they do NOT seem to be accepted❌
    * 's title describe the content
  * editing BIP's
    * language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.)
    * markup (for reST BIPs)
    * code style (_Example:_ [BIP 8](bip-0008.md))
  * assign BIP numbers
    * NORMALLY, 
      * NEXT AVAILABLE one
    * SOMETIMES,
      * special/joke number
  * change BIP's status
  * reject BIP proposals
    * POSSIBLE Reasons:🧠
      * BIP is too unfocused OR too broad
      * duplicated
      * disregard for formatting rules
      * technically unsound
      * NOT 
        * proper motivation OR
        * backwards compatibility OR
        * Bitcoin philosophy
  * | author is ready,
    * merge the PR 
  * list it | [README.md](README.mediawiki)
  * sending email back -- to the -- BIP author / next steps
