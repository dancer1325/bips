# What is a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) ?

* BIP
  * == design document /
    * describe (technical + rationale) a NEW feature about
      * Bitcoin OR
      * 's processes or environment
    * provide
      * information -- to the -- Bitcoin community
  * 's goal
    * mechanisms / 
      * propose new features
      * collect issue's community input
      * document the design decisions
  * 's author
    * responsible for
      * building consensus | community
      * documenting dissenting opinions
  * == text files / hosted | versioned repository

# BIP Types -- `Type:` --

* Standards Track
  * change / affects | MOST OR ALL Bitcoin implementations
    * _Examples:_ 
      * change the network protocol
      * change block or transaction validity rules
      * change or add the interoperability of applications / use Bitcoin
  * == design document + reference implementation
    * reference implementation
      * recommendations
        * AFTER being reviewed and accepted, create it
      * == code OR patch OR URL to that

* Informational
  * == Bitcoin design issue OR general guidelines OR information to the Bitcoin community
    * ❌!= NEW feature❌
    * ❌!= Bitcoin community consensus OR recommendation❌
      * -> ⚠️users and implementers can ignore them⚠️

* Process
  * around Bitcoin
    * ❌!= Bitcoin codebase❌
    * informative OR propose a change
  * vs Standards Track BIPs
    * ❌!= topics❌
  * ⚠️requirements⚠️
    * community consensus
      * ❌!= recommendations❌
      * ❌!= Informational❌
  * _Examples:_
    * | decision-making process,
      * add procedures,
      * add guidelines,
      * add changes
    * | Bitcoin development,
      * adjust tools or environment 
    * meta-BIP
      * == about BIP process

# BIP Work Flow

* BIP champion OR author / EACH potential BIP
  * == someone /
    * writes the BIP / follows the style and format
    * shepherds the discussions | appropriate forums
    * tries to build community consensus
    * name the BIP -- via -- an alias (== author's name/nick + BIP subject)
      * _Example:_ "bip-johndoe-infinitebitcoins"

* [BIP editors](#bip-editors)

* ❌NOT BIPs use cases❌
  * small enhancements OR patches
    * -> handle DIRECTLY -- via -- Bitcoin issue tracker

* 💡BIPs workflow 💡

  <img src=bip-0001/process.png></img>

* 1! NEW idea for Bitcoin / BIP
  * check that it's BIP-able == check |
    * Bitcoin Talk forum
    * Bitcoin Dev mailing list
      * [gnu archived mailing list](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/)
        * [FIRST page os mails](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/?t=20110617064236)
      * [google group mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/bitcoindev)

* "Draft" BIP 
  * BIP author creates
    * | 
      * Bitcoin Dev mailing list
        * Reason:🧠
          * add ADDITIONAL concerns
          * format it🧠
      * this repo
        * follow style
    * recommendations
      * separate SIG mailing list
        * ❌NOT used right now❌
      * dedicated GIT repository OR branch
  * if the [BIP editor](#bip-editors) approves it -> 
    * assign the BIP a number,
    * [label it](#bip-types----type---)
    * assign status "Draft"
    * merge | BIPs git repository

* "Accepted"
  * requirements
    * description clear and complete
    * net improvement
    * solid / NOT complicate the protocol

* "Final"
  * BIP / status = "Accepted" & implementation is completed and accepted by the community 

* "Deferred"
  * NO progress done
  * assigned -- by -- BIP author or editor 
  * BIP editor can re-assign it -- to -- draft status

* "Rejected"
  * == NOT good idea
  * important to record it

* "Active"
  * 👀:= NEVER meant to be completed👀
  * use cases
    * Informational BIPs
    * Process BIPs
  * _Example:_ BIP 1 (this BIP)

# What are BIP's parts?

* [Preamble](#bip-header-preamble)
  * _Example:_ top of this file

* Abstract
  * technical issue / is addressed
    * ~200 word
  * _Example:_ [BIP0002's Abstract](bip-0002.md#abstract)

* Copyright/public domain
  * explicitly label
  * place | public domain ( == version | this BIP)
  * license | Open Publication License
  * _Example:_ [BIP0002's Copyright](bip-0002.md#copyright)

* Specification
  * if it's a NEW feature -> describe the syntax + semantics 
  * detailed enough / can be implemented -- by -- any current Bitcoin platform (Satoshi, BitcoinJ, bitcoin-js, libbitcoin)
  * _Example:_ [BIP0008's Specification](bip-0008.md#specification)

* Motivation
  * == why the existing protocol specification is inadequate -- to -- address the problem
    * if insufficient motivation -> may be rejected
  * BIPs' critical part / want to change the Bitcoin protocol
  * _Example:_ [BIP0008's Motivation](bip-0008.md#motivation)

* Rationale 
  * == what motivated the design + particular design decisions + alternative designs ALREADY discussed
    * == provide evidence of consensus
  * _Example:_ [BIP0003's Rationale](bip-0003.md#rationale)

* Backwards Compatibility 
  * use cases
    * BIPs / introduce backwards incompatibilities
  * == backwards incompatibilities + their severity + how to deal with them
    * if insufficient backwards compatibility treatise -> may be rejected
  * _Example:_ [BIP0008's Backwards compatibility](bip-0008.md#backwards-compatibility)

* Reference Implementation 
  * ⚠️required BEFORE getting "Final" status⚠️ 
  * ❌NOT required before getting "Accept" status❌
  * recommendations
    * write AFTER
      * finish the specification and rationale
      * reach consensus
  * != final implementation (+ test code + documentation)
  * _Example:_ [BIP0008's Reference implementation](bip-0008.md#reference-implementation-)

* use cases
  * original author 
    * has NO longer time
    * is NOT interested in updating it
  * someone is interested in taking over

* responsible for
  * checking BIP
    * was PREVIOUSLY sent -- to the -- Bitcoin development mailing list
    * is ready (sound and complete)
      * if it's 
        * NOT ready -> send it back -- to the -- author
        * ready -> create a PR | [this repo](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips)

    * markup (for reST BIPs)
    * code style (_Example:_ [BIP 8](bip-0008.md))
  * assign BIP numbers
    * NORMALLY, 
      * NEXT AVAILABLE one
    * SOMETIMES,
      * special/joke number
  * change BIP's status
  * reject BIP proposals
    * POSSIBLE Reasons:🧠
      * BIP is too unfocused OR too broad
      * duplicated
      * disregard for formatting rules
      * technically unsound
      * NOT 
        * proper motivation OR
        * backwards compatibility OR
        * Bitcoin philosophy🧠
  * | author is ready,
    * merge the PR 
  * list it | [README.md](README.mediawiki)
  * sending email back -- to the -- BIP author / next steps
  * making strictly-editorial BIPs changes
    * _Examples:_ correcting misspellings, fixing broken links, etc.

# History

* 's structure
  * derived heavily -- from -- [Python's PEP-0001](https://github.com/python/peps/blob/main/peps/pep-0001.rst)

# Changelog

* 10 Oct 2015
  * clarifications about
    * submission process
